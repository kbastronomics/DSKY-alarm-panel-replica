# DSKY Alarm Indicator Panel Replica

## *This project is a work in progress -- reuse at your own risk*

This is a scale functional replica of the Alarm Indicator panel for the Apollo Guidance Computer. It is
designed to be part of a larger replica of the Display and Keyboard (DSKY) module of the AGC.

This project is composed of these component subfolders:

* artwork - artwork to be silk-screened onto the front transparent acrylic cover

* pcb - KiCad project for the controller PCB design

* hardware - 3D-printable frame components designed using Fusion 360. STEP and Fusion source files available. Hardware models used in thie replica were derived from models found in the [AGC Mechanical CAD project](https://github.com/rrainey/agc-mechanical-cad).

## Credits and Related Projects

This project is inspired by work by Ben Krasnow creating a DSKY Electroluminescent Panel replica. You'll
find information about that project in [this Applied Science video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2o_Sp2-aBo) by Ben. Like Ben's E/L display, this project is driven by an AT SAMD21 microcontroller chip; the same chip is used in the multiple Adafruit microcontroller boards, including the Adafruit Trinket M0.
